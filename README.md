# Malicious-Website

This project was created as a final project for my Introduction to Practical Security Assessment class. It is a website that has an area at the bottom of the page that automatically sends an email to the email address that is provided. For my project we decided to use this to send a malicious link to the person which would take control of their system once clicked on.

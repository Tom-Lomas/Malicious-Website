# Malicious-Website

This project was created as a final project for my Introduction to Practical Security Assessment class. It is a website that has an area at the bottom of the page that automatically sends an email to the email address that is provided. For my project we decided to use this to send a malicious link to the person which would take control of their system once clicked on. We chose to entice people by sending them an email thanking them for subscribing to our newsletter and added a pdf of the "newsletter". This newsletter was actually a malicious file that we created. As of now we were not able to send the pdf through gmail as they have a built in antivirus that catches it but we would love to work on this more in the future.

The website was a basic representation of this website https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/spicy-kale-and-corn-stuffed-chicken-breasts-recipe-2040840
